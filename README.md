### What I learned

By working on this challenge, I successfully gained a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. The tricky part about this challenge was to center each individual component and make it as close to the final design as possible. I deepened my knowledge of the flexbox model, which allowed me to control the positioning and alignment of elements within my designs. Additionally, I explored the fundamentals of media queries and their importance in creating responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes. Through this process, I recognized the significance of prioritizing a mobile-first workflow to ensure optimal usability across all platforms.
